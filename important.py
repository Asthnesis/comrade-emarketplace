# Sample Python code to simulate the process of retrieving transaction details,
# identifying the buyer and seller, checking payment status, product delivery,
# and disbursing funds using a hypothetical API (e.g., Safaricom Daraja B2C).

# Please note that this is a simplified example and does not interact with real APIs or databases.

# Define a function to simulate retrieving transaction details from a database
def get_transaction_details(transaction_id):
    # This is a placeholder for database retrieval logic
    # In a real scenario, this would involve querying a database
    transaction_details = {
        'transaction_id': transaction_id,
        'buyer_id': 'buyer123',
        'seller_id': 'seller456',
        'amount': 1000,
        'product_received': False
    }
    return transaction_details

# Define a function to simulate checking if the buyer has sent the amount


def check_payment_status(buyer_id, transaction_id):
    # This is a placeholder for payment status check logic
    # In a real scenario, this would involve checking a payment system or API
    payment_status = True  # Assuming payment is made for simplicity
    return payment_status

# Define a function to simulate updating the product delivery status


def update_product_delivery_status(transaction_id, status):
    # This is a placeholder for updating delivery status in the database
    # In a real scenario, this would involve updating a database record
    transaction_details['product_received'] = status
    return transaction_details

# Define a function to simulate disbursing funds to the seller


def disburse_funds_to_seller(seller_id, amount):
    # This is a placeholder for disbursing funds using Safaricom Daraja B2C API
    # In a real scenario, this would involve making an API call to Safaricom Daraja B2C
    # Here we'll just print a message to simulate the disbursement
    print(
        f"Disbursing {amount} to seller with ID {seller_id} using Safaricom Daraja B2C")


# Main process
transaction_id = 'txn001'  # Example transaction ID
transaction_details = get_transaction_details(transaction_id)

# Check if the buyer has sent the amount
if check_payment_status(transaction_details['buyer_id'], transaction_id):
    # Update the product delivery status (assuming the product is received for simplicity)
    transaction_details = update_product_delivery_status(transaction_id, True)

    # Check if the product is received by the buyer
    if transaction_details['product_received']:
        # Compare the seller's ID in the database to the one identified
        # For simplicity, we assume the seller's ID matches and proceed to disburse funds
        disburse_funds_to_seller(
            transaction_details['seller_id'], transaction_details['amount'])
    else:
        print("Product not received by the buyer yet.")
else:
    print("Payment not received from the buyer.")
